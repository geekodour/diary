## 22:12 festivals {#22-12-festivals}

idk what it tells of me, but since last 7-8 years festivals have been the days i feel the saddest and loneliest in, A1 otherwise. esp late evening when someone across the road thought it'd be a good idea to play "jane kyun log pyar karte hain"/90s bollywood sads in full speakers
