## 08:30 Worried about not having strong opinions {#08-30-worried-about-not-having-strong-opinions}

So I was reading [this post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18190005). I really like how articulate the comment author is about their arguments etc. If I put myself in their shoes I will never be able to make such arguments even if I was the author of the package/lib. I think this boils down to few things out of many all of which I seem to be missing and I need to work on

1.  Knowing the subject matter deeply, in practice, theory and history
2.  Having a touch with current industry practices around the idea being talked about
3.  Ability to recall minor details to rebut the claims made by the other person.
    -   This requires understanding what the other person said and understanding where they're coming from. Think it's a great skill to have.

Anyway, man I have so much to work on myself.
