## 20:23 a time in life {#20-23-a-time-in-life}

a time in life comes when you realize, you're old. have not done anything significant and most probably will never be able to do anything significant. Did not have fun in your 20s, did not even grind properly, basically you feel doomed. But you tell yourslef,  it's not over. Hope is a bitch but it's the only thing that can be the seed to the infinite belief in yourself. I'll not stop till I get what I want. No matter what. This moment is one such moment. I feel defeated but at the end of the day it's me who decides if the game is over or no. It's not over till I win.
