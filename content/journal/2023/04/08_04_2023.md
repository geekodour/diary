## 07:26 about ints in programming languages {#07-26-about-ints-in-programming-languages}

I had sort of a realization today, idk how correct it is or whatever, but i think i never saw ints as binary data when i code

```python
somevar = 77
# now I'll imagine somevar as 77
# but that's not what it exactly is, it's binary inside.
# so nice to see somevar for what it is compared to thinking it is 77
# 77 is just a representation of the integer that somevar contains
```
