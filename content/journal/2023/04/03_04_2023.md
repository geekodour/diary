## 17:04 Stupid past me {#17-04-stupid-past-me}

-   I am really hating myself rn (more precisely past me)
-   So I had this habit of taking notes right and I take notes in a way I am talking to my future self
-   So I used to write smart ass statements like
    -   "Well you should not do this or should do that, because ofc"
    -   "Okay X uses P, so you know what you gotta do"
-   This is so stupid. My past(then present) knows what I gotta do, my future self needs help of the past self, so future me doesn't know fumb duck!
-   I'll do better. That's it that's the rant, fuck you past me.
